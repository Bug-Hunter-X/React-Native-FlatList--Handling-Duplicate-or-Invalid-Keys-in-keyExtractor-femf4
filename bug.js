This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an invalid key prop to its items.  The key prop is crucial for FlatList's efficient rendering and data management.  If keys are not unique or are improperly generated, you'll encounter unexpected behavior like incorrect item rendering or display, or even crashes. For example:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{id: 1, name: 'Item 1'}, {id: 2, name: 'Item 2'}, {id: 1, name: 'Item 3'}]}
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} // Duplicate ID - Problem!
/>
```

In this code, the `keyExtractor` uses `item.id`, but there are duplicate `id` values (1 is used twice). FlatList relies on unique keys to identify and update items efficiently. Duplicates lead to unpredictable behavior.
